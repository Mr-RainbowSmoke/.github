## Before You Start
1. Check existing issues/PRs to avoid duplicates.

## Development Standards (Default)
Unless a repository says otherwise:

## Branching & Commits
- Branch naming: `feat/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `chore/<name>`, `docs/<name>`
- Commit style: clear, present-tense, scoped when possible  
  Examples:
  - `feat(api): add event ingestion endpoint`
  - `fix(worker): handle missing env vars`

## Pull Requests
A good PR includes:
- What changed + why
